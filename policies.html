        <h1>Overview of roles of Indian Government:</h1>

        <ol>
         several initiatives and steps have been taken by the Indian government to address water wastage and promote water conservation. Keep in mind that developments may have occurred since then. Here are some of the key measures taken by the Indian government:

         <li>Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Launched in 2019, the Jal Shakti Abhiyan aims to create awareness about water conservation at the grassroots level. The campaign includes the revival of traditional water bodies, watershed management, and efficient water use.</li>
         
         <li>National Water Mission: The National Water Mission, one of the eight national missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, focuses on water conservation, minimizing wastage, and ensuring more equitable distribution of water.</li>
         
         <li> Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY): This scheme aims to improve farm productivity and ensure efficient water use in agriculture by promoting the use of micro-irrigation techniques, rainwater harvesting, and watershed management.</li>
         
         <li>Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABHY): Launched to address the critical issue of depleting groundwater levels, ABHY focuses on sustainable groundwater management and community participation in water resource management.</li>
         
         <li>Namami Gange Project: While primarily focused on cleaning and rejuvenating the Ganges River, the project also includes measures to improve water use efficiency and reduce pollution, indirectly contributing to water conservation.</li>
         
         <li> Har Khet Ko Pani (Every Field, Water): This initiative is part of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and aims to enhance water use efficiency in agriculture through the adoption of modern irrigation practices.</li>
         
         <li> Rainwater Harvesting: Various states and local governments have implemented programs to encourage rainwater harvesting in urban and rural areas. Rainwater harvesting helps recharge groundwater levels and reduces dependency on external water sources.</li>
         
         <li> Mandatory Water Audits: Some cities have implemented mandatory water audits for industries and commercial establishments to monitor and control water usage.</li>
         
        <li>Water Conservation and Management Rules: The Central Ground Water Authority has issued guidelines and rules for the regulation and control of groundwater extraction to prevent over-exploitation.</li>
